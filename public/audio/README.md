# Audio Files Directory

This directory should contain your audio files for the karaoke application.

## File Format
- Supported formats: MP3, WAV, OGG
- Recommended: MP3 for best compatibility and file size

## Sample Files
For testing, you can add sample audio files here:
- demo-song-1.mp3
- demo-song-2.mp3
- demo-song-3.mp3

## Usage
Update the `audioUrl` property in your song data to point to these files:
```typescript
audioUrl: '/audio/your-song-file.mp3'
```

## Note
The current implementation uses placeholder audio URLs from external sources for demonstration. Replace these with your actual audio files for production use.

## Legal Considerations
Ensure you have proper licensing for any copyrighted music used in your application.
